As a self-taught UI Developer with over 5 years of experience working in fintech and design agency companies, I have honed my skills in UI design and front-end development. My expertise lies in using technologies such as Javascript, Typescript, and Vuejs, in addition to RESTful and GraphQL to create advanced architectures with a simple approach.

My understanding of UI design allows me to act as a liaison between the design and development teams, ensuring pixel-perfect implementation of designs. I have also demonstrated leadership skills, mentoring junior developers and designers to achieve their working goals and complete their tasks efficiently.

Overall, I am passionate about creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces that enhance user experiences. With my technical expertise and design knowledge, I am confident in my ability to contribute value to any organization.
